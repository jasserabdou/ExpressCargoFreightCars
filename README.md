- **Stations**: There are multiple stations in the system where freight cars can move between.
- **Freight Cars**: Freight cars are responsible for carrying containers between stations. The system supports various types of containers, including normal, heavy, refrigerated, and liquid containers. Each container type has specific handling requirements.
- **Container Management**: Containers can be loaded from a station onto a freight car, and vice versa. The system ensures proper handling and management of containers during loading and unloading operations.
- **Fuel Management**: Freight cars require a certain amount of fuel to travel from one station to another. The system tracks fuel levels and manages refueling operations to ensure uninterrupted movement of freight cars.
